# Image Classification Projects Using Hugging Face

#### Overview

This repository features two image classification projects using Hugging Face’s Vision Transformers (ViT):

- **Traffic Light Classification**: a binary task to detect the presence (1) or absence (0) of a stop sign.
- **Beans Leaf Classification**: a multi-class task to classify between Healthy Bean, Rust Bean, and Angular Leaf Spot.

Both projects demonstrate the use of ViT models.
