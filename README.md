# Image Classification Projects Using Hugging Face

#### Overview

This repository contains two related image classification projects using Hugging Face’s Vision Transformers (ViT):
- Traffic Light Classification – distinguishing between stop and non-stop traffic lights.
- Crypto Beans Classification – applying the knowledge from the traffic light project to classify images of Crypto Beans.

Both projects demonstrate the use of pre-trained ViT models and fine-tuning for custom image datasets.
